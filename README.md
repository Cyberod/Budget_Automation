# Budget Automation System

The **Budget Automation System** is a versatile tool designed to help users manage their finances effectively. It provides both a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** and a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, allowing users to choose their preferred mode of interaction. The system enables users to create, customize, and manage budget plans, breaking down their finances into categories and subcategories with percentage-based allocations.

## Features

- **Predefined Budget Plans**: Choose from popular budgeting strategies like:
  - Conservative (50-30-20)
  - Moderate (60-20-20)
  - Aggressive (70-10-20)

- **Custom Budget Plans**: Create personalized budget plans with custom categories and percentage allocations.

- **Subcategory Management**: Add subcategories to budget categories for more granular financial planning.

- **Dual Interface Options**:
  - **GUI**: A user-friendly interface built with `Tkinter` for an interactive experience.
  - **CLI**: A lightweight command-line interface for quick and efficient budgeting.

- **Persistent Storage**: Save and load budget plans using a JSON-based storage system.

- **Budget Breakdown**: Automatically calculate and display category-wise and subcategory-wise budget allocations based on user-defined percentages.

## How It Works

1. **Choose an Interface**: Start the system and select either the GUI or CLI.
2. **Select or Create a Budget Plan**:
   - Use predefined plans for quick setup.
   - Create a custom plan by defining categories and their percentage allocations.
3. **Input Total Budget**: Enter the total amount to be distributed.
4. **View Results**: Get a detailed breakdown of your budget, including subcategories if applicable.
5. **Save Plans**: Save your custom plans for future use.

## File Structure

- **`src/gui`**: Contains the GUI implementation using `Tkinter`.
- **`src/cli`**: Contains the CLI implementation for command-line interaction.
- **`src/core`**: Core logic for calculations, storage, and plan management.
- **`data/budget_plans.json`**: Stores saved budget plans in JSON format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `Tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Budget_Automation.git
